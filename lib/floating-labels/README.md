FlowupLabels.js
===============

Augments form labels to behave like placeholders, but with a twist.

[SEE DEMO](http://enfos.com/FlowupLabels.js/demo/)

[Demo simulating disabled JS](http://enfos.com/FlowupLabels.js/demo/index-nojs.html)

Original concept by [Matt D. Smith](http://dribbble.com/shots/1254439--GIF-Mobile-Form-Interaction). Inspired by Mike Mitchell's [FloatLabel.js](https://github.com/m10l/FloatLabel.js).


Difference in this version: 
----

* The label gets out of the user's way immediately on focus
* Labels should be proceeded by a colon ":", to indicate that the user still has something to fill. Users commonly mistake placeholder labels as prefilled inputs, an example being the common "Search..."
* This implementation accounts for pre-filled elements on page load (toggleable)
* Uses semantic labels, not placeholders


Usage instructions
-----

* Add jquery.FlowupLabels.css to your stylesheets:

``` html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/jquery.FlowupLabels.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/main.css">
```


* Add jquery.FlowupLabels.js to your scripts.

``` html
<script src="js/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="js/jquery.FlowupLabels.js"></script>
<script src="js/main.js"></script>
```



* Wrap your form in the '.FlowupLabels' class
* Wrap your labels and inputs with the '.fl_wrap' class
* Give labels the '.fl_label' class
* Give inputs the '.fl_input' class
* Load the plugin

``` js
$('.FlowupLabels').FlowupLabels({
		/*
		These are all the default values
		You may exclude any/all of these options
		if you won't be changing them
		 */
		// Handles the possibility of having input boxes prefilled on page load
		feature_onLoadInit:	true, 
		
		// Class when focusing an input
		class_focused: 		'focused',
		// Class when an input has text entered
		class_populated: 	'populated'	
});
```
